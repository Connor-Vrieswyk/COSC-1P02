			<h2> --- What is Secret Santa? --- </h2>
				
			<p>
			Secret Santa is a Christmas tradition. Members of a group of friends, family, or coworkers draw random names to 
			someone’s Secret Santa. The Secret Santa is given a wish list of gift ideas to choose from to give to their chosen 
			giftee. After opening their present, the giftee has to guess which member of the group was their Secret Santa. It’s a 
			holiday classic where the guessing is as much a part of the fun as receiving the gift.
			</br></br>
			While everyone seems to have some of their own rules when it comes to Secret Santa, the idea can be traced back to 
			the Scandinavian tradition of knocking on someone’s door, throwing a present inside when it opens, then running away. 
			They call this Juklapp, or “knocking Christmas.” Or, roots may trace back even further to German legends about St. 
			Nick’s helpers, who doled out presents to good kids, but not to the bad, but one thing is for certain. The tradition 
			continues to evolve over the years.
			</p>
			
			<h2> --- What are the rules? --- </h2>
			
			<p>
			Traditional Secret Santa rules, in essence, are pretty simple: no one knows who is getting whom a gift. But 
			organizing a gift exchange with your friends, family, or coworkers can be a bit more complicated. Here are the 
			steps for hosting a traditional Secret Santa game in-person:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
				<strong>Write down each name on a piece of paper.</strong></br>
				Gather all the participants up and have them scribble their names on a piece of paper. Encourage legibility, 
				otherwise you’ll have people buying gifts for “does that say...Floger? Smoged?” If it’s hard to get them all 
				in the same room, you can do this yourself after each person agrees by text or email to go full elf.
				</li>
				</br>
				<li>
				<strong>Have everyone write down a gift suggestion or two.</strong></br>
				Players can write down something specific like thick red knee high socks, or something pretty vague like 
				“a book, please.” The more specific the better, though, to ensure everyone gets something they actually want.
				</li>
				</br>
				<li>
				<strong>Draw names to randomly assign a Secret Santa to each player.</strong></br>
				This is the fun part; reach into the hat and find out whose Christmas you’ll be making better! The host can 
				also do this solo and email, call, or text the other players their assigned name—just make sure you keep 
				things straight with a top secret list of who’s assigned to whom. Not even Rudolph can help you if you lose 
				the master list!
				</li>
				</br>
				<li>
				<strong>Plan a gift exchange party.</strong></br>
				Pick a day when everyone can get together, preferably before people leave for their Christmas vacations. 
				Make sure each gift is tagged with the recipient’s name, but not the gifter’s! Exchange gifts, goodies, 
				and holiday cheer to last all year.
				</li>
				</br>
				<li>
				<strong>Guess who drew your name.</strong></br>
				Guessing who your sneaky Secret Santa is, and revealing your own elfy nature to the person you gifted a 
				present to, is the reindeer’s knees. Who got you the book for your next book club meeting? Who knows how much 
				you’ve been craving chocolate? Was it Allison? No? Then it must be...Allison? Wait, did I already guess that?
				</li>
				</br>
			</ol>
